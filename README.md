## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-My Motivation to complete this project was to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to become a developer. I built this project to get failar with the main coding languages and develop a study guide. This helps students study for a coding bootcamp. I learned how to not only use the main coding langauges, but use github and my local computer in order to have my study guide come into fruition.



## Installation

1. Create the HTML for the Prework Study Guide
2. Add CSS to the Prework Study Guide
3. Add Basic JavaScript to the Prework Study Guide
4. Add JavaScript Functions to the Prework Study Guide
5. Deploy the Prework Study Guide

## Usage

Use each section as a notes area and each of the sections will contain nores to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
